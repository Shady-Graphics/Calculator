Calculator
==========

A simple android calculator

For my extra feature I have chosen to add a number of extra functions these are:

  •	  Backspace Button
  
  • 	Square root button
  
  • 	Percentage button
  
  • 	As well a number of buttons to add memory functionality
  
    These are Memory clear: which deletes what ever number is stored in memory
  
    Memory Recall: which takes the number in memory and display it on screen
  
    Memory Minus: Subtracts the number on the display from the number in memory
  
    Memory Plus: Adds the number on the display to the number in memory
