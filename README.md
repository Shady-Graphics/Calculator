Calculator
==========

A simple android calculator

For my extra feature I have chosen to add a number of extra functions these are:

  •	  Backspace Button
  
  • 	Square root button
  
  • 	Percentage button
  
  • 	As well a number of buttons to add memory functionality
  
    o	  These are Memory clear: which deletes what ever number is stored in memory
    
    o	  Memory Recall: which takes the number in memory and display it on screen
    
    o 	Memory Minus: Subtracts the number on the display from the number in memory
    
    o 	Memory Plus: Adds the number on the display to the number in memory
